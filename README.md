# Market-Segmentation-Analysis (Study Task)

Definition -

Market segmentation analysis is the study of customers, divided into smaller groups, to understand their specific characteristics like 
behavior, age, income, and personality. It’s easier for companies to advertise when they’re marketing a smaller segment of customers; this way, 
each campaign can be highly targeted and precise to the characteristics of each group. How a company should showcase a product or service
depends on which group they’re targeting.
